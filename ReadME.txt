The folder "mapreduce-kmeans" contains the source code. Inside the folder, there is another fold called target, which contains a standalone executable jar. To run it on Hadoop, the command is:

$ hadoop jar <k-means jar path> au.edu.rmit.bdp.clustering.mapreduce.KMeansClusteringJob <configuration file path> <input file path> <output path>

The "stdout.txt", "stderr.txt", "syslog.txt", "metadata.txt", and "counters.txt" were directly copy from the file generated in Hadoop. For each iteration of clustering, the system generated the files above. To avoid massive and duplicated data (there are hundreds of iterations which may generate similar files), files generated by one iteration were attached here.

File "configuration.txt" contains the parameters for the project, which includes the centre coordinate of the New York City, the range of initial centroids, and the initial number of clusters.

File "2-2-7-6.csv" and "2-2-7-6_opf.txt" are the output of one clustering run. 2-2-7-6 indicates this run was on 2 nodes, using the 2 MB dataset, with 7 initial centroids, and the 6th run. "2-2-7-6.csv" contains the final cluster result. There are four columns in this file, column 1 and 2 are the longitude and latitude of the centroid, and column 3 and 4 are the longitude and latitude of the pick-up location. "2-2-7-6_opf.txt" contains other information of the result, including final number of clusters, objective function value, total time cost, and number of iterations taken.

The graph "Clustering Visualisation For 2.2MB Dataset" was one of the clustering result displayed on google map.
